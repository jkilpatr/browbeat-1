Browbeat
========

This started as a project to help determine the number of database
connections a given OpenStack deployment uses via stress tests. It has
since grown into a set of Ansible playbooks to help check deployments
for known issues, install tools, run performance stress workloads and
change parameters of the overcloud.

Before running browbeat
=======================

-  Execute the ansible/generate_tripleo_hostfile.sh script (builds the ssh config)
-  Configure browbeat-config.yaml to match your tests

How to run Browbeat Stress Tests?
=================================

On the Undercloud host, as the Stack user jump into the browbeat venv
and you simply run:

::

    (browbeat-venv)[stack@ospd browbeat]$ ./browbeat.py --help

However, the playbook required to install browbeat and its
dependencies(Rally, Shaker, Perfkit) needs to be run before this.
DEtailed install and run instructions are presented in a section below.

What is necessary?
==================

-  TripleO**

   Why? We use passwordless ssh to reach each controller instance and
   compute instance.

-  Ansible

   Why? We started with using bash to make changes to the Overcloud,
   creating complex sed/awks that we get for free with Ansible (for the
   most part). Other monitoring and stress test tools are installed by
   the respective playbooks when run.

If you prefer to not use Ansible, the older versions (no longer
maintained) of the browbeat.sh can be found in a older commit.

** If you are interested in contributing a connector for your OpenStack Distribution, please review the Contributing section.

Detailed Install, Check and Run
===============================

Installing Browbeat and running the Overcloud checks can be performed
either from your local machine or from the undercloud. The local machine
install/check assumes you have ansible installed already.

    (browbeat-venv)[stack@ospd ansible]$ cd ..
    (browbeat-venv)[stack@ospd browbeat]$ vi browbeat-config.yaml # Edit browbeat.cfg to control how many stress tests are run.
    (browbeat-venv)[stack@ospd browbeat]$ ./browbeat.py <workload> #perfkit, rally, shaker or "all"

Running PerfKitBenchmarker
==========================

Work is on-going to utilize PerfKitBenchmarker as a workload provider to
browbeat. Many benchmarks work out of the box with browbeat. You must
ensure that your network is setup correctly to run those benchmarks and
you will need to configure the settings in
ansible/install/group_vars/all.yml for browbeat public/private
networks. Currently tested benchmarks include: aerospike, bonnie++,
cluster_boot, copy_throughput(cp,dd,scp), fio, iperf, mesh_network,
mongodb_ycsb, netperf, object_storage_service, ping, scimark2, and
sysbench_oltp.

To run browbeat's PerfKit Benchmarks, you can start by viewing the
tested benchmark's configuration in conf/browbeat-perfkit-complete.yaml.
You must add them to your specific browbeat config yaml file or
enable/disable the benchmarks you wish to run in the default config file
(browbeat-config.yaml). There are many flags exposed in the
configuration files to tune how those benchmarks run. Additional flags
are exposed in the source code of PerfKitBenchmarker available on the
Google Cloud Github_.

.. _Github: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker

Example running only PerfKitBenchmarker benchmarks with browbeat from
browbeat-config.yaml:

::

    (browbeat-venv)[stack@ospd browbeat]$ ./browbeat.py  perfkit -s browbeat-config.yaml

Contributing
============

Contributions are most welcome!  You must first create a
Launchpad account and `follow the instructions here <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#account-setup>`_
to get started as a new OpenStack contributor.

Once you've signed the contributor license agreement and read through
the above documentation, add your public SSH key under the 'SSH Public Keys'
section of review.openstack.org_.

.. _review.openstack.org: https://review.openstack.org/#/settings/

You can view your public key using:

::

    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_*.pub

Set your username and email for review.openstack.org:

::

    $ git config --global user.email "example@example.com"
    $ git config --global user.name "example"
    $ git config --global --add gitreview.username "example"

Next, Clone the github repository:

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/openstack/browbeat.git

You need to have git-review in order to be able to submit patches using
the gerrit code review system. You can install it using:

::

    $ sudo yum install git-review

To set up your cloned repository to work with OpenStack Gerrit

::

    $ git review -s

It's useful to create a branch to do your work, name it something
related to the change you'd like to introduce.

::

    $ cd browbeat
    $ git branch my_special_enhancement
    $ git checkout !$

Make your changes and then commit them using the instructions
below.

::

    $ git add /path/to/files/changed
    $ git commit

Use a descriptive commit title followed by an empty space.
You should type a small justification of what you are
changing and why.

Now you're ready to submit your changes for review:

::

    $ git review


If you want to make another patchset from the same commit you can
use the ammend feature after further modification and saving.

::

    $ git add /path/to/files/changed
    $ git commit --amend
    $ git review

If you want to submit a new patchset from a different location
(perhaps on a different machine or computer for example) you can
clone the browbeat repo again (if it doesn't already exist) and then
use git review against your unique Change-ID:

::

    $ git review -d Change-Id

Change-Id is the change id number as seen in Gerrit and will be
generated after your first successful submission.

The above command downloads your patch onto a seperate branch. You might
need to rebase your local branch with remote master before running it to
avoid merge conflicts when you resubmit the edited patch.  To avoid this
go back to a "safe" commit using:

::

    $ git reset --hard commit-number

Then,

::

    $ git fetch origin

::

    $ git rebase origin/master

Make the changes on the branch that was setup by using the git review -d
(the name of the branch is along the lines of
review/username/branch_name/patchsetnumber).

Add the files to git and commit your changes using,

::

    $ git commit --amend

You can edit your commit message as well in the prompt shown upon
executing above command.

Finally, push the patch for review using,

::

    $ git review

Adding functionality
--------------------

If you are adding new functionality to Browbeat, either new workloads or new plugins for existing workloads you are required to add testing for that funcrionatliy in.

::

    $ ci-scripts/install-and-check.sh

See the README.rst in the ci-scripts folder for more details on the structure of the script.
